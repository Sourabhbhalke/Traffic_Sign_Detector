ipynb notebook for quick proof of concept and practice of traffic sign detection


This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify German traffic signs. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Files

- **My_traffic_sign_detector.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and testing the traffic sign detector model.
- **traffic_sign_model.h5**: Pre-trained model file that can be loaded for quick predictions.
- **Example Images**: Sample images of German traffic signs for testing the model's predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed by running the first few cells in the notebook.

2. **Load the Model**: Use the `traffic_sign_model.h5` file to load the pre-trained model and skip the training process for quick predictions.

3. **Run Predictions**: Use the provided example images or your own images to test the model. Simply load an image and pass it through the model to get the predicted traffic sign.

## Usage Tips

- **Customization**: Modify the notebook to train the model on different datasets or tweak the architecture for improved performance.
- **Experiment**: Try with different images to see how the model performs in real-world scenarios.

Happy coding!
